# Data Science Portfolio
Portfolio of data science projects completed by me for self learning.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning
  
  - [Stone Data Challenge - Portuguese competition](https://github.com/GabrielP98/DataChallengeStone/blob/main/StoneFinalVersion.ipynb): A model to predict the revenues from over two hundred thousand clients for the next 3 months during covid outbreak.
  - [Ames Housing dataset](https://github.com/GabrielP98/data-science/blob/main/house-price/house-price-project.ipynb): With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home. Kaggle's score: top 10%
  - [Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge](https://github.com/GabrielP98/data-science/blob/main/store-item-demand-forecasting/TimeSeriesFinalVersion.ipynb): A model to predict how much each store will sell for each time for the next 3 months. You are given 5 years of store-item sales data and have to deal with seasonality in a huge dataset. 



  _Tools: Time Series stats models, scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib_
